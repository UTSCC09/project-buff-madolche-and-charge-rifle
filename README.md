## Top 5 Technical Challenges

### Real-time Collaboration
* How to allow team members to collaborate with each other in real-time, synchronizing changes, and ensuring consistent data.

### User Sign Up and Log In
* Implementing signing up and logging in, tracking user sessions, integrating with other sign-up methods.

### Connecting Front-End and Back-End
* How to use GraphQL and other tools to transfer the data between frontend and backend.

### Managing User Permissions
* Keeping track of what users are able to access, ensuring that only authenticated users can view/edit, inviting other users to view and edit documents, changing visibility of documents.

### In-line Comments
* Can implement with line numbers but may be slow or prone to breaking, or create some kind of logical object for sentences/lines that comments are attached to, or do as character offset from start of document.
